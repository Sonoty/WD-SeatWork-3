                <img src="../footer/assets/img/shukaku.png" alt="Description 1">
                <p>Shukaku is most closely affiliated with the Hidden Sand village, and his first known Jinchuriki was the priest Bunpuku. The clergyman was followed by another host not important enough to be named, before Shukaku was placed inside an unborn Gaara, still in his mother’s womb.</p>

                <img src="../footer/assets/img/matatabi.png" alt="Description 2">
                <p>Matatabi is a prime example of how tailed beasts were exploited by ninja in past ages. Captured by Konoha's Hashirama Senju, Matatabi was sold to the Hidden Cloud as part of a deal supposed to foster peace and balance between the five major villages. </p>

                <img src="../footer/assets/img/isobu.png" alt="Description 3">
                <p>Isobu was sold by Hashirama as part of the Five Kage Summit agreement, this time to the Hidden Mist village. When war inevitably broke out, Isobu was forcibly sealed within Konoha's Rin Nohara with the intention of releasing her upon an unsuspecting Leaf. Aware of the plot, Rin sacrificed herself so she wouldn't hurt the people she loved.</p>

                <img src="../footer/assets/img/son goku.png" alt="Description 4">
                <p>Son Goku was sold to the Hidden Rock village and came to be sealed within Roshi. Compared to many Bijuu/Jinchuriki pairings, Roshi and Son Goku shared a respectful relationship, but the shinobi came to regret never learning his beast's true name.</p>

            <div class="gallery-item">
                <img src="../footer/assets/img/kokuo.png" alt="Description 5">
                <p>Kokuo joined Son Goku in the Hidden Rock and eventually passed to a powerful ninja known as Han. Like many other Jinchuriki, Han was killed when the Akatsuki (secretly led by the evil Madara Uchiha) began collecting the Tailed Beasts, forcibly extracting each critter from their human hosts.</p>

            <div class="gallery-item">
                <img src="../footer/assets/img/saiken.jfif" alt="Description 6">
                <p>Saiken belonged to the Hidden Mist village, the idea being that each village's beasts would total roughly nine tails (apart from the Sand). This was to keep the power balance relatively equal, as the more tails a Bijuu possesses, the stronger they're considered to be.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="gallery-item">
                <img src="../footer/assets/img/chomei.png" alt="Description 7">
                <p>Chomei was formerly sealed within Fu, a female ninja from the Hidden Waterfall, after being sold to the village by Hashirama. This was unusual, since the Waterfall isn't one of Naruto's five major nations, but were considered powerful enough to be included in the arrangement. </p>

            <div class="gallery-item">
                <img src="../footer/assets/img/gyuki.jpg" alt="Description 8">
                <p>Gyuki was sold to the Hidden Cloud village along with Matatabi, but the nation struggled to find a Jinchuriki who could control it. One of these was Blue B, the nephew of the Third Raikage, but after Gyuki went on a rampage, the Raikage was forced to seal him away, causing his nephew’s tragic death.</p>

            <div class="gallery-item">
                <img src="../footer/assets/img/kurama.jpg" alt="Description 9">
                <p>As the only Bijuu not captured by the First Hokage, Kurama roamed in the wild for many years until he was found by Madara Uchiha and forced to fight Hashirama. The First Hokage emerged victorious, and Kurama was sealed within his wife, Mito Uzumaki, before being transferred to Kushina Uzumaki.</p>
